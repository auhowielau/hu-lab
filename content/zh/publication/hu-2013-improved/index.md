abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian model, an improved hierarchical Dirichlet process-hidden Markov model (iHDP-HMM), for visual document analysis. The iHDP-HMM is capable of clustering visual documents and capturing the temporal correlations between the visual words within a visual document while identifying the number of document clusters and the number of visual topics adaptively. A Bayesian inference mechanism for the iHDP-HMM is developed to carry out likelihood evaluation, topic estimation, and cluster membership prediction. We apply the iHDP-HMM to simultaneously cluster motion trajectories and discover latent topics for trajectory words, based on the proposed method for constructing the trajectory word codebook. Then, an iHDP-HMM-based probabilistic trajectory retrieval framework is developed. The experimental results verify the clustering accuracy of the iHDP-HMM and trajectory retrieval accuracy of the proposed framework.'
