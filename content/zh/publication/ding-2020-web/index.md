abstract: 'To protect underage people from accessing objectionable videos in the Internet, an effective objectionable video recognition algorithm is necessary for web filtering. Recently, the multi-instance learning has been introduced for objectionable video recognition and achieves impressive results. However, hand-crafted features as well as redundant and noisy frames in objectionable videos become an intractable problem that inevitably degrades the recognition performance. In this paper, we propose a novel representative prototype selection algorithm embedding deep multi-instance representation learning. In the proposed method, an improved convolutional neural network is designed for multimodal multi-instance feature learning and a self-expressive dictionary learning model based on sparse and low rank constraint is designed to select the representative prototypes from each subspace of instances. Then the bag-level feature is constructed via mapping the bag to the selected prototypes. Experiments on three objectionable video sets show the effectiveness of our method for objectionable video recognition.'
