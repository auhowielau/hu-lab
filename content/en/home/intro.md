The **Vision & Security Laboratory (VSLab)** is affiliated to the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([**CASIA**](http://english.ia.cas.cn/)) and the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition ([**NLPR**](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/en/)). VSLab is led by Prof. [**Weiming Hu**](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~huweiming?language=en), with an energetic team consisting of more than 10 researchers and nearly 40 MSc/PhD candidates. The research interests of VSLab mainly cover computer vision, pattern recognition, and machine learning, with a focus on the following topics: object tracking, object detection & segmentation, action recognition, face forgery detection, knowledge distillation, multi-label recognition, multiple instance learning, weakly-supervised learning, etc. Until now, VSLab has published over **200 papers**, in which more than **100 papers** are on top journals or conferences (**TPAMI / IJCV / CVPR / ICCV / ECCV, etc**). Besides, VSLab has won multiple **top academic awards**, e.g., the Visual-Object-Tracking 2018 (VOT 2018) real-time track and ICCV 2019 - English & Chinese double tracks of VATEX Captioning Challenge. In short, VSLab is devoted to the research of fundamental theories and innovative methods around “**AI + Security**”, and our developed technologies and systems have been successfully applied in many real-world scenarios.
