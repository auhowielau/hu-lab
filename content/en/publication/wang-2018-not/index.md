abstract: 'This work presents a novel end-to-end trainable CNN model for high performance visual object tracking. It learns both low-level fine-grained representations and a high-level semantic embedding space in a mutual reinforced way, and a multi-task learning strategy is proposed to perform the correlation analysis on representations from both levels. In particular, a fully convolutional encoderdecoder network is designed to reconstruct the original visual features from the semantic projections to preserve all the geometric information. Moreover, the correlation filter layer working on the finegrained representations leverages a global context constraint for accurate object appearance modeling. The correlation filter in this layer is updated online efficiently without network fine-tuning. Therefore, the proposed tracker benefits from two complementary effects: the adaptability of the fine-grained correlation analysis and the generalization capability of the semantic embedding. Extensive experimental evaluations on four popular benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance.'
