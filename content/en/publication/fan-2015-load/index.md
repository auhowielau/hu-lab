abstract: 'Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is a mainstream method for the Near Duplicate Image Detection (NDID) problem. Previous LSH based methods, however, do not have a principled way to make the indexing structure generate the buckets of similar sizes, which will inevitably degrade the detection effectiveness and efficiency. In this work, we propose a Load-Balanced Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LBLSH) method with a new indexing structure to produce load-balanced buckets for the hashing process. As proved in the paper, the proposed LBLSH can guarantee load-balanced buckets in the hashing process and significantly reduce the query time and the storage space. Based on the proposed LBLSH method, we design an effective and feasible algorithm for the NDID problem. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.'
